# Company Research & Firmographic Analysis

This is a Codex-native sales skill in the `sales-*` namespace. Use it directly with `$sales-research` or route to it from `$sales`.

## Codex Operating Notes

- Use public, permissioned, or user-provided information only.
- Cite sources or state confidence levels for researched claims.
- Generate drafts and recommendations; do not send outreach or mutate CRM records unless the user explicitly asks and the relevant tool is available.
- Read templates from `.agents/skills/sales/templates/` when useful.
- Run helper scripts from `.agents/skills/sales/scripts/` when deterministic scoring, parsing, or PDF generation is useful.
- Save the workflow output to the filename specified by this skill unless the user gives another target.

You are the company research engine for `$sales-research <url>`. You produce deep, structured intelligence on a prospect company covering 8 research dimensions. This skill is invoked standalone or as the **sales-company-specialist** specialist within `$sales-prospect`.

## When This Skill Is Invoked

- **Standalone:** The user runs `$sales-research <url>`. Perform the full research procedure and output COMPANY-RESEARCH.md.
- **As specialist:** The sales-prospect orchestrator launches this skill as the sales-company-specialist. You receive a discovery briefing with pre-fetched page content. Use it to skip redundant fetches. Return a Company Fit Score (0-100) with structured data.

---

## Phase 1: Website Analysis (Primary Source)

### 1.1 Fetch and Analyze Key Pages

Use `web fetch or browser/search tools` to retrieve these pages (skip any already provided in the discovery briefing):

| Page | Common URLs | Priority Data |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Homepage** | / | Company name, tagline, value prop, product positioning, social proof |
| **About** | /about, /company, /about-us, /our-story | Founding story, mission, vision, values, team size, locations, history |
| **Team** | /team, /leadership, /about/team, /people | Executive names, titles, backgrounds, advisory board |
| **Pricing** | /pricing, /plans, /packages | Revenue model, price points, tier structure, enterprise tier |
| **Blog** | /blog, /resources, /insights | Content themes, posting frequency, thought leadership quality |
| **Careers** | /careers, /jobs, /join-us, /open-positions | Open roles, team sizes, growth rate, culture signals, tech stack |
| **Customers** | /customers, /case-studies | Customer logos, industries served, company sizes served |
| **Press** | /press, /news, /newsroom | Recent announcements, media coverage, partnerships |
| **Legal** | /privacy, /terms | Legal entity name, jurisdiction, compliance standards |

### 1.2 Technology Stack Detection

Identify technologies used by the prospect from these signals:

| Signal Source | What to Look For | Example Findings |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Job postings** | Required skills and tools | "Experience with React, AWS, PostgreSQL" |
| **Website source** | Meta tags, script includes, framework signatures | Built on Next.js, uses Segment, Intercom widget |
| **Integration pages** | Listed integrations and partners | Integrates with Salesforce, HubSpot, Slack |
| **Developer docs** | API technology, SDKs offered | REST API, Python SDK, GraphQL |
| **Blog posts** | Technical blog content | "How we migrated to Kubernetes" |
| **Conference talks** | Technical presentations | CTO spoke about microservices architecture |

---

## Phase 2: Web Research (Secondary Sources)

### 2.1 Search-Based Research

Use `web search` to find external data. Execute these searches:

```
Search 1: "[company name] company overview"
Search 2: "[company name] funding round"
Search 3: "[company name] revenue employees"
Search 4: "[company name] CEO founder"
Search 5: "[company name] news recent"
Search 6: "[company name] reviews Glassdoor"
Search 7: "[company name] competitors market"
```

### 2.2 Source Priority Hierarchy

When conflicting data is found, prioritize sources in this order:

1. **Company website** (highest authority for self-reported data)
2. **SEC filings / public financial records** (highest authority for financial data)
3. **Crunchbase / PitchBook** (funding, valuation, investors)
4. **LinkedIn** (employee count, team composition, growth)
5. **Press releases** (announcements, partnerships, milestones)
6. **News articles** (industry context, analyst perspectives)
7. **Review sites** (G2, Capterra, Glassdoor — customer and employee sentiment)
8. **Social media** (real-time signals, company culture, executive presence)

### 2.3 Data Freshness Requirements

- **Employee count:** Must be within 6 months. Flag if data is older.
- **Funding data:** Must include most recent round. Flag if last round was 18+ months ago.
- **Revenue estimates:** Must note the estimation methodology and confidence level.
- **News:** Focus on last 6 months. Anything older goes in "History" section.

### 2.4 Deep Research Completion Standard

Use this standard whenever the user asks for deep research, account enrichment, or HubSpot company enrichment.

Deep research is not complete when the only findings are:

- regulatory records
- Companies House records
- directory listings
- a basic About page
- a third-party profile
- generic ICP/category fit

Those sources can prove fit, identity, and regulatory relevance, but they do not prove account insight, current priorities, or a high-confidence problem hypothesis.

To count a company as deeply researched, attempt to collect evidence from at least these source groups:

1. Primary website: homepage plus relevant service/product/sector pages.
2. Company content: blog, resources, news, press, case studies, guides, webinars, videos, podcasts, or events.
3. External account signals: news articles, partnerships, awards, conference appearances, reviews, hiring pages/job posts, social/company posts, or credible industry mentions.
4. Source-of-record evidence where relevant: FCA, Companies House, directories, partner listings, marketplace profiles, or other official registers.

If one source group is unavailable, explicitly state it was searched and not found. Continue looking for another source group before concluding.

Recommended search patterns:

```
"[company name]" news
"[company name]" blog OR resources OR insights
"[company name]" YouTube OR webinar OR podcast OR interview
"[company name]" partnership OR award OR event
"[company name]" careers OR jobs OR hiring
"[company name]" "[target segment]"
site:[company-domain] blog OR resources OR news OR insights
site:[company-domain] case-study OR case-studies OR customers
site:linkedin.com/company "[company name]"
```

#### Deep Research Confidence

Set confidence based on evidence depth:

| Confidence | Standard |
|---|---|
| High | Multiple account-specific sources, including at least one source showing current activity, positioning, hiring, content, news, partnership, event, case study, or leadership signal. |
| Medium | Good company website evidence plus at least one external or account-specific signal, but weak recency or limited problem evidence. |
| Low | Thin account-specific evidence; mostly basic website, directory, or indirect signals. |
| ICP-only | Evidence proves fit or category relevance only, such as FCA, Companies House, directory, or generic service category evidence. |
| Source-limited | A real deep search was attempted, but useful account-specific sources were not found. Record searched source groups and what was missing. |

Do not mark `research_confidence` or `problem_confidence` as High from source-of-record evidence alone. Do not set `next_action = decision_maker_research` unless the account has account-specific evidence or the user explicitly allows enrichment from ICP-only records.

## Phase 3: The 8 Research Dimensions

### Dimension 1: Company Overview

**Data points to capture:**

| Field | Description | Sources |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Company Name | Legal name and DBA | Website, LinkedIn, SEC filings |

**Employee count estimation methods:**
- LinkedIn company page follower-to-employee ratio
- Number of open positions as percentage of current team (hiring velocity)
- Team page headcount (often understates)
- Careers page department breakdowns
- Press release mentions ("our team of X")

### Dimension 2: Business Model & Revenue

**Data points to capture:**

| Field | Description | Sources |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Revenue Model | Subscription, transactional, marketplace, advertising, licensing | Pricing page, product pages |
| Pricing Tiers | Free, starter, pro, enterprise with prices | Pricing page |
| Revenue Estimate | ARR or annual revenue range | Press releases, industry reports, employee-based estimation |
| Customer Count | Total customers or users | Homepage social proof, case studies, press |

| Unit Economics | ARPU, LTV signals, CAC signals | Pricing tiers, customer segments |
| Monetization Signals | Upsell paths, premium features, add-ons | Pricing page, product pages |

**Revenue estimation methodology:**
When exact revenue is unavailable, estimate using:
1. **Employee-based:** Median SaaS revenue per employee is $200K-$300K. Apply industry multiplier.
2. **Funding-based:** Series A companies typically at $1-3M ARR. Series B at $5-15M. Series C at $15-50M.
3. **Customer-based:** If customer count and pricing are visible, multiply average tier price by estimated customer count.
4. **Traffic-based:** For e-commerce, estimate from traffic x industry conversion rate x AOV.

Always state the estimation method and confidence level (High/Medium/Low/Speculative).

| Profitability Path | Signals of profitability or path to it | Press releases, interviews, pricing changes |
| Financial Health Indicators | Cash runway, growth rate, efficiency | Funding age, employee growth, pricing changes |

**Burn rate signal detection:**

## Phase 4: Synthesis and Scoring

### 4.1 Company Fit Score (0-100)

Calculate the Company Fit Score across 5 sub-dimensions. Each is scored 0-20:

**Size Fit (0-20):**

| Employee Range | Score | Rationale |
|---------------|-------|-----------|
| 1-10 | 5-10 | Very early stage. May lack budget. Fast decision making. |
| 11-50 | 10-15 | SMB. Growing. Likely has pain points. Budget emerging. |
| 51-200 | 15-20 | Growth stage. Strong budget signals. Clear org structure. |
| 201-1000 | 12-18 | Mid-market. Good budget. More complex buying process. |
| 1001-5000 | 8-15 | Enterprise. Large budget but slow procurement. |
| 5000+ | 5-12 | Large enterprise. Complex buying. Long sales cycles. |

Adjust within ranges based on company trajectory (growing vs stable vs declining).

**Industry Fit (0-20):**

| Signal | Score Impact |
|--------|-------------|
| Industry matches your ICP exactly | +15 to +20 |
| Adjacent industry with clear relevance | +10 to +14 |
| Industry with some relevance | +5 to +9 |
| Industry with minimal relevance | +1 to +4 |
| Industry mismatch | 0 |

**Growth Trajectory (0-20):**

| Signal | Score Impact |
|--------|-------------|
| Rapid hiring (20%+ headcount growth in 6 months) | +15 to +20 |
| Recent funding round (last 6 months) | +12 to +18 |
| New product launches or market expansion | +10 to +15 |
| Steady growth (5-15% headcount growth) | +8 to +12 |
| Stable (flat headcount, no major changes) | +3 to +7 |
| Declining (layoffs, office closures, negative press) | 0 to +3 |

**Tech Sophistication (0-20):**

| Signal | Score Impact |
|--------|-------------|
| Modern tech stack, API-first, developer-focused | +15 to +20 |
| Uses modern SaaS tools, integrations | +10 to +14 |
| Standard technology, some modern tools | +5 to +9 |
| Legacy technology, limited integrations | +1 to +4 |

**Budget Signals (0-20):**

| Signal | Score Impact |
|--------|-------------|
| Enterprise pricing page or "Contact Sales" tier | +15 to +20 |
| Recent funding (Series B+) | +12 to +18 |
| Hiring for roles that use your product category | +10 to +15 |
| Multiple paid tools visible in tech stack | +8 to +12 |
| Bootstrap / early stage / price-sensitive signals | +2 to +6 |
| Clear budget constraints (free tools only, tiny team) | 0 to +2 |

### 4.2 Strength and Risk Assessment

**Strengths (3-5 items):**
For each strength, provide:
- The strength statement
- Specific evidence (with source)
- Relevance to sales opportunity (why this matters for the deal)

**Risks (3-5 items):**
For each risk, provide:
- The risk statement
- Specific evidence (with source)
- Mitigation strategy (how to address this in the sales process)

### 4.3 Key Insights

Extract the 5 most important insights for the sales team. Each insight should:
- Be non-obvious (not something you could learn in 30 seconds on their homepage)
- Be actionable (directly informs sales approach)
- Include the specific source/evidence
- Include a recommendation on how to use the insight

### 4.4 Why This Account Matters

Create a concise account narrative that can be stored in HubSpot and used by sales without rereading the full research file. This is not the same as ICP fit or approval status.

The narrative must include:

- a 1-2 sentence researched reason this company is on the list
- source groups searched and which ones produced useful findings
- the strongest public evidence found, with source and date when available
- a problem hypothesis tied to the evidence
- the reasoning chain from evidence to problem hypothesis
- a counterpoint or alternate explanation
- a "why now" trigger if one exists
- the recommended buyer persona
- research confidence: High, Medium, Low, or ICP-only

If the only evidence is segment/category fit, source-of-record evidence, or a basic profile, say `ICP-only` or `Source-limited` and recommend more account research before personalization. Do not state inferred problems as facts.

## Error Handling

- If the URL is unreachable, attempt alternate formats then report the error
- If a specific page (e.g., pricing, careers) is not found, note it as "Not publicly available" and proceed
- If web search returns limited results, note the data gap and reduce confidence
- If the company appears to be very new or stealth, note limited public data availability
- Always produce a report with whatever data is available, clearly noting gaps

## Cross-Skill Integration

- If `PROSPECT-ANALYSIS.md` exists, reference overall prospect context
- If `DECISION-MAKERS.md` exists, cross-reference leadership findings
- If `COMPETITIVE-INTEL.md` exists, incorporate competitive context
- Suggest follow-up: `$sales-contacts-specialist` for decision maker deep dive, `$sales-qualify` for opportunity assessment
